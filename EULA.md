electronic, or other form, that describe the installation, operation,
use, or technical specifications of the Software.

</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">License Grant and Scope</span>.  Subject
to and conditioned upon Licensee's strict compliance with all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Licensor hereby grants to
Licensee a one-time, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
limited license during the Term solely to evaluate the Software and
Documentation for Licensee's internal evaluation purposes, without
charge, for a term of thirty calendar days from Licensee's first
installation of the Software (the "Trial Period").  Licensee may not
utilize the Software or Documentation after the Trial Period expires
unless he or she/it purchases a Software license from Licensor. Licensee
may terminate the Trial Period at any time by ceasing use of the
Software and Documentation.  Licensor has no obligation to make the
Software or any of its functionality available to Licensee if Licensee
fails to purchase a Software license before termination or the end of
the Trial Period.  Licensee acknowledges that, if Licensee does not
purchase a Software license from Licensor before termination or the end
of the Trial Period, Licensee may experience certain consequences,
including without limitation interruptions in use of the Software. 
Licensor is not responsible for any consequences arising from or related
to Licensee's failure to timely purchase a Software license. </span>

IF YOU ARE DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE USING A BETA VERSION OF
THE SOFTWARE, READ THIS:  all of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement apply, except that Licensor grants to Licensee only a

non-sublicensable license solely to provide feedback on the Software to

test products and likely contain bugs, errors, and other problems that
could cause system malfunctions and other failures, including but not
limited to system crashes, interruptions, and data loss.  Licensee will
use caution and not rely in any way on the performance or functioning of
beta versions of the Software.  The beta versions of the Software are
made available to Licensee free of charge and NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND IS
PROVIDED.  Licensee's rights with respect to any beta version of the
Software will terminate automatically upon expiration of that beta
version Software based on the system
date<span class="MsoCommentReference">, on UTC time (</span>currently
anticipated to occur in February or March 2018, but subject to change in
Licensor's sole discretion).  This period of use is referred to as the

the Beta Term, Licensee must upgrade to the initial commercial release
version of the Software on or before the Beta Term expiration
date.
